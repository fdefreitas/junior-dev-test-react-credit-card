# Junior Developer React Technical Test

It's your first day at work on an online payments company. You've finished onboarding and are just being assigned some tickets for making a couple style changes to a section of the platform were admins can review credit cards that have been recently added to the system.

For the preview to be closer to what cards look like in real life you've been asked to:
- [ ] Split the credit card number in groups of 4 numbers for display.
- [ ] Fix logo sizes to make the preview height consistent across providers.
- [ ] Remove the "Cardholder's name" title from the preview.
- [ ] Display the "Expires End" section below the cardholder's name.

The code for this technical test is based on the companion repo ([devmode-io/react-credit-card-component-starter](https://github.com/devmode-io/react-credit-card-component-starter)) created by Devmode.io for their
[Create a credit card component with React](https://devmode.io/articles/create-a-credit-card-component-with-react/) tutorial.
